Ideas:
----
- creep spawning logic (which GCL, how much energy is left after spawning and are there enough harvester)
- optimization on all roles (example: only upgrader should use energy from storage if necessary and other changes)
- all screeps (with work-bodypart) get the upgrader or collecter funktionality if they have nothing else to do
- after GCL is 2: claim new room and build it up (stable population, upgrade roomcontroller, build towers and other structures)
- additional roles: guard, healer, knight, ranger, etc. (see Role ideas below)
- modify all screeps: "panikroom", building roads (maybe a thing for the constructor), etc. (see Role ideas below)
- working with a defcon level like: https://arcath.net/2016/12/screeps-part-8-constructors-defcon

Roles that need to be implemented:
----
- claimer
- guard
- lorry
- repairer
- wallRepairer
- builder

Role ideas + modifies for existing roles (ideas from "Pantek59"):
----
- dont use all energy to spawn creeps like harvester
- 1-5 = Priority
- (5) new role "constructor" -> evertime new GC Level is reached puts the new buildings in specific layout --> https://docs.screeps.com/api/#ConstructionSite
- (1) modify "builder": -> only spawns if there is a construction site, after building go upgrade till death
- (5) new role "energy hauler": -> transport energy from remote stationary harvesters back to spawn room
- (1) new role "miniHarvester": -> needs only 200 energy, if all creeps die and not enough energy is stored
- (3) new role "protector": -> spawns if "Panic Flag" is set and goes there to protect this room
- (3) new role "remoteHarvester": -> harvest sources in remote rooms
- (4) new role "guard": goes to "Protect Flag" and guards this area
- (5) new role "remoteStationaryHarvester": -> like a miner just in a remote room and can build container if there is no
- (2) new role "demolischer": -> spawned if "Demolisher Flag" is set and dismantles construction site
- (2) new role: "scout": -> runs to other rooms and tells if he is attack or if he find hostile/other creeps
- (4) modify "scout": dont come back if you get attacked or find other creeps, set "Gank Flag" and try to leave the room to search for more
- (4) new role: "healer": heals the tank or ranger
- (4) new role: "ranger": ranged attacker, tries to stay behind tank or out of meele range
- (4) new role: "tank": high life, meele attacker
- (5) new squad: "Gank Squad": one healer, two ranger, one tank
- (5) modify "Gank Squad": if scout founds a room with other creeps go there and gank
- (5) modify "Gank Squad": attack creeps near RoomController, if there is a wall or rampart, attack all creeps that walk through rampart
