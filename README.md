# ScreepsUltimate
Refactored and chaned scripts for the game "screeps".

Info:
----
This is my refactoed AI for the game 'Screeps'.
Inspired by the tutorial from 'th_pion'.
But from now on I will work alone on my AI and develop it further.

- Screeps API Reference: https://docs.screeps.com/api/

Currently working on:
----
- dont use all energy to spawn creeps like harvester
- put the maximum number of creeps per role into the code
- new role: guard (in testing phase)
- new function on the lorry: collects dropped energy (higher priority than collect energy from the container) -> https://docs.screeps.com/api/#Creep.pickup
